I'm editing go file \`${REPO_ROOT}/pkg/controller/direct/${SERVICE}/${PROTO,,}_controller.go\` and you should help me to fix the go imports if needed.

Some hints:
- You should only change the import path for \`${SERVICE}pb\` and \`gcp\`, and the functions from those package if needed.
- Their import packages should be under "cloud.google.com/go".
- You should search ${REPO_ROOT}/.build/third_party/googleapis/google to find the right package and functions. 

Once you fixed the import error, print the message in Json format

{"status": "success"}
