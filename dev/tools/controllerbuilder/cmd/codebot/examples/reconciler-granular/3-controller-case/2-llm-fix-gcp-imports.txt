I'm editing go file `${REPO_ROOT}/pkg/controller/direct/${SERVICE}/${PROTO,,}_controller.go` and you should help me to fix the go imports if needed.

Some hints:
- You should only change the import path for `${SERVICE}pb` and `gcp`
- Their import packages should be under "cloud.google.com/go".
- You should search ${REPO_ROOT}/.build/third_party/googleapis/google to find the right package. 

Once you are done, print the message in Json format

{"status": "success"}
